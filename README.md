# Interlude
Hi-Res local and on demand streaming service build with Tauri

## Resume Bullet Points

• **Engineered high-fidelity audio player** using Rust and Tauri achieving bit-perfect WASAPI playback for 24-bit/192kHz lossless formats (FLAC/ALAC/WAV)

• **Architected full-stack desktop application** with Symphonia audio decoder, React frontend, and SQLite database supporting seamless library management and real-time playback control

• **Integrated multi-platform streaming APIs** (Tidal, Qobuz, Amazon) via song.link, enabling on-demand hi-res audio access with intelligent service prioritization

• **Delivered polished Spotify-inspired UX** with dynamic gradient theming, advanced search (Fuse.js), and persistent state management using Zustand
